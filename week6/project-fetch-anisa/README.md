# ðŸ“š Book Manager App

A simple React app to manage a list of books â€” fetch, add, and delete â€” using state management with Context API and a custom hook. This project is a study case for learning React fundamentals including useState, useEffect, custom hooks, and async API handling.

### âœ… Fetch Book List (Simulated from Products API)
- Data fetched from [dummyjson.com/products](https://dummyjson.com/products)

- Shows book title, price, and category

### âœ… Add New Book
- Add a book using a form with:
  - **Title**
  - **Price**
  - **Category**
- Data is stored only in local state (no real API call)

### âœ… Delete Book
- Each book card has a "Delete" button
- Deletion affects local state only

### âœ… Global State with Context API
- Uses React Context (`BookContext`) to manage global book list
- Shared state accessible from all components

### âœ… Custom Hook - `useBooks`
- Centralized logic for:
  - Fetching books
  - Adding a book
  - Deleting a book
  - Handling loading and error states
